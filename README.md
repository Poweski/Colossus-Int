## Colossus Int
ColossusInt is a C++ class that allows you to store integer digits in a dynamically allocated array. It supports assigning values ​​of type `int` and copying content between objects of the class, taking care of proper memory management. The implementation implements arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`, which operate on ColossusInt objects without conversion to primitive types, which allows you to handle very large numbers. The class supports both positive and negative numbers, and also allows you to convert its value to text using the `sToStr()` method.
